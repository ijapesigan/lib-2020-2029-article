  abstract = {In this article we provide an overview of existing approaches for relating latent class membership to external variables of interest. We extend on the work of Nylund-Gibson et al. (Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 2019, 26, 967), who summarize models with distal outcomes by providing an overview of most recommended modeling options for models with covariates and larger models with multiple latent variables as well. We exemplify the modeling approaches using data from the General Social Survey for a model with a distal outcome where underlying model assumptions are violated, and a model with multiple latent variables. We discuss software availability and provide example syntax for the real data examples in Latent GOLD.},
