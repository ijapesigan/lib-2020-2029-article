  abstract = {Background: Transdermal alcohol biosensors measure alcohol use continuously, passively, and non-invasively. There is little field research on the Skyn biosensor, a new-generation, wrist-worn transdermal alcohol biosensor, and little evaluation of its sensitivity and specificity and the day-level correspondence between transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) and number of self-reported drinks. Methods: Participants ($N = 36$; 61\% male, $M_{age} = 34.3$) wore the Skyn biosensor and completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys about their alcohol use over 2 weeks. A total of 497 days of biosensor and EMA data were collected. Skyn-measured drinking episodes were defined by TAC > $5 \mu g / L$. Skyn data were compared to self-reported drinking to calculate sensitivity and specificity (for drinking day vs. nondrinking day). Generalized estimating equations models were used to evaluate the correspondence between TAC features (peak TAC and TAC-area under the curve (AUC)) and number of drinks. Individual-level factors (sex, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, human immunodeficiency virus status, and hazardous drinking) were examined to explore associations with TAC controlling for number of drinks. Results: Using a minimum TAC threshold of $5 \mu g / L$ plus coder review, the biosensor had sensitivity of 54.7\% and specificity of 94.6\% for distinguishing drinking from nondrinking days. Without coder review, the sensitivity was 78.1\% and the specificity was 55.2\%. Peak TAC ($\beta = 0.92, p < 0.0001$) and TAC-AUC ($\beta = 1.60, p < 0.0001$) were significantly associated with number of drinks. Females had significantly higher TAC levels than males for the same number of drinks. Conclusions:  Skyn-derived TAC can be used to measure alcohol use under naturalistic drinking conditions, additional research is needed to accurately identify drinking episodes based on Skyn TAC readings.},
