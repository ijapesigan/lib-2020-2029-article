  abstract = {Many methods have been developed to infer reciprocal relations between longitudinally observed variables. Among them, the general cross-lagged panel model (GCLM) is the most recent development as a variant of the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM), while the random-intercept CLPM (RI-CLPM) has rapidly become a popular approach. In this article, we describe how common factors and cross-lagged parameters included in these models can be interpreted, using a unified framework that was recently developed. Because common factors are modeled with lagged effects in the GCLM, they have both direct and indirect influences on observed scores, unlike stable trait factors included in the RI-CLPM. This indicates that the GCLM does not control for stable traits as the RI-CLPM does, and that there are interpretative differences in cross-lagged parameters between these models. We also explain that including such common factors as well as moving-average terms in the GCLM makes this interpretation very complicated.},
